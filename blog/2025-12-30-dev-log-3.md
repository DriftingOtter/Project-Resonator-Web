**TL;DR:** The first finished version of the Project Resonator guide is officially live! New dedicated documentation website, finalized crossover in "v1.0" state, comprehensive wiki entries for PCB design, shell design, and manufacturing. Administrative sections (How to Contribute, Licensing, FAQ) now complete. Future plans include IEC711 coupler testing, custom crossover simulator, and TWS designs.

Hey everyone,

It's been a long year.

## The Foundation is Complete

<div className="card margin-vert--md">
  <div className="card__body">
    <p>When I started Project Resonator, it was born out of a simple, perhaps slightly insane, "Why not?" I was bored, I had fallen in love with the IEM hobby, and I wanted to see if I could demystify the "black magic" of wearable audio engineering.</p>
    
    <div className="alert alert--success margin-vert--md">
      Today, I'm incredibly proud to announce that the <strong>first finished version of the Project Resonator guide is officially live.</strong>

## What's New?

<div className="card margin-vert--md">
  <div className="card__header">
    <h3>Major Documentation Overhaul</h3>
  </div>
  <div className="card__body">
    <p>I've spent the last several sessions overhauling the documentation to move it from a collection of notes to a professional-grade resource.</p>
    
    <ul className="margin-top--md">
      <li><strong>New Wiki Entries:</strong> Finalized high-level technical guides for <strong>PCB Design</strong>, <strong>Shell Design (Fusion 360 workflow)</strong>, and <strong>Manufacturing Advice</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Dedicated Documentation Website:</strong> While the GitHub Wiki served us well, I wanted something easier to navigate. The new site is cleaner, faster, and much easier to parse on a phone or tablet. You can now access information without constantly navigating the GitHub repository</li>
      <li><strong>Finalized Crossover:</strong> After hundreds of simulations and tweaks, the 4-BA 4-Way passive crossover is finally in its "Version 1.0" state</li>
      <li><strong>Administrative Overhaul:</strong> Added <strong>How to Contribute</strong>, <strong>Licensing (CERN-OHL-W)</strong>, and <strong>FAQ</strong> sections to protect the open-source spirit and make contributing easier</li>
    </ul>
    
    <div className="alert alert--info margin-top--md">
      <div className="alert__body">
        The v1.0 crossover designation means it's at a state I can confidently call "pretty good." Changes will only be made when really required or requested.

## Current State and Next Steps

<div className="card margin-vert--md">
  <div className="card__body">
    <p>I'm at a point where I feel comfortable leaving the majority of the current project as-is. The major building point of this initiative was never just to make "My IEM", but rather to create a foundation that allowed <em>others</em> to understand the development cycle of an IEM from start to finish.</p>
    
    <div className="alert alert--warning margin-vert--md">
      <div className="alert__header">
        <strong>Honest Admission</strong>
      </div>
      <div className="alert__body">
        I'll be the first to admit that some of the current Fusion 360 files and "Ready-to-Print" models are a bit messy (I know 💀). I'm going to be working on cleaning those up to ensure they serve as a clean, polished template for you to work from.

## This Isn't the End

<div className="card margin-vert--md">
  <div className="card__header">
    <h3>Future Plans</h3>
  </div>
  <div className="card__body">
    <p>Regarding the future direction of this project, I am not abandoning it. I have significant plans moving forward:</p>
    
    <ul className="margin-top--md">
      <li>
        <strong>Better Data:</strong> I'm investing in an <strong>IEC711 coupler</strong> and <strong>Dayton Audio impedance testing kits</strong>. My goal is to buy a wide array of drivers and manually test them myself. By tracking source impedance and noise accurately, I can provide you with FRD and ZMA files that you can just "drag and drop" into a simulator with 100% confidence
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Custom Crossover Simulator:</strong> I'm aiming to build a custom crossover simulator better suited for creating IEM crossovers and overall acoustics - simulating inner-ear acoustics, better integration with FRD and ZMA files, simulation of ear seal leakage, and better integration with the data I'll be collecting
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>New Models:</strong> I want to explore TWS (True Wireless) designs and other hardware innovations once the "Reference" wired model is fully settled
      </li>
    </ul>

## A Personal Reflection

<div className="card margin-vert--md">
  <div className="card__body">
    <p>This project has been a massive undertaking. It took me a year to get here, juggling university, personal life, and the steep learning curve of acoustic physics. I've remade things hundreds of times.</p>
    
    <p className="margin-top--md">But seeing the support from the Reddit community and the active contributors raising issues on GitHub has made every late night worth it. I fell in love with the concept of creating sound in such a tiny form factor, and I wanted to share that feeling with you.</p>
    
    <div className="alert alert--success margin-vert--md">
      Whether you're here to build the reference model or to use my guides to start your own company, I hope this resource is something you find useful.
    </div>
    
    <p className="margin-top--md"><strong>Thank you for being part of this journey.</strong></p>

**TL;DR:** Project is still moving forward. The PCB has been redesigned to fit the shell properly, which improves component placement and reduces crosstalk/noise. I've also started developing EarCanvas, a cross-platform open-source node-based tuning app. On top of that, I'm working with my college on potential funding to build the first working prototype. The reason for the long silence is that college and extra summer courses took most of my time, but I've been making steady progress in the background.

Hey everyone,

It's been a while since I last posted about this project, so I figured it's time for an update. For anyone who doesn't remember, I've been working on an open-source IEM project (Project Resonator), which is a project that provides all the resources (shell design, crossover/PCB, driver selection, measurements) required to DIY your IEM from scratch. The idea is to provide a central hub of measurements, knowledge, and techniques to help this wonderful community out so that we can not only hear great sound, but also build it ourselves.

## Apologies for the Silence

<div className="alert alert--info margin-vert--md">

First off, I want to apologize for going quiet. College got really intense this past semester, and then I loaded up with extra summer courses so I could get ahead for research. School has to come first, as I'm sure most of you understand, but that doesn't mean this project hasn't been a priority too — just not the number one priority. I've still been making progress in the background.

## Hardware Improvements: PCB Redesign

<div className="card margin-vert--md">
  <div className="card__header">
    <h3>PCB Redesign</h3>
  </div>
  <div className="card__body">
    <p>On the hardware side, the PCB went through a big improvement. Originally it was just a simple square board sitting inside the shell, which wasn't really making good use of the space. I redesigned it to actually wrap around the inner contour of the shell.</p>
    
    <p className="margin-top--md">That change lets me:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Spread components out more intelligently</li>
      <li>Improve routing</li>
      <li>Reduce crosstalk</li>
      <li>Cut down on electrostatic noise in the traces</li>
    </ul>
    
    <div className="alert alert--success margin-top--md">
      This redesign is a significant step forward in making the IEM more reliable and reducing potential audio artifacts that could come from poor component placement.

## Software Development: EarCanvas

<div className="card margin-vert--md">
  <div className="card__header">
    <h3>EarCanvas - Node-Based Tuning Editor</h3>
  </div>
  <div className="card__body">
    <p>On the software side, I've started working on something I'm calling <strong>EarCanvas</strong>. It's a drag-and-drop, node-based, visual tuning editor (similar to Blender geometry nodes); kind of like a Wavelet or Equalizer APO, but designed to be completely cross-platform (Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android).</p>
    
    <p className="margin-top--md">The idea is to give people one system-agnostic way to build and share (JSON files) tuning setups without being locked to a single OS. And since it's open-source under GPLv3, anyone who wants to add features or experiment with different DSP blocks can jump in and contribute to the public repo.</p>

## Visual Design: Colorways

<div className="card margin-vert--md">
  <div className="card__body">
    <p>I've also been mocking up some different colorways so it doesn't just look like a grey box, and I'll share those once I've cleaned them up (you can see what they look like in the mock ups directory).</p>
  </div>
</div>

## Funding and Prototyping

<div className="alert alert--success margin-vert--md">

And the most exciting part: I've been in talks with some friends and with my college about getting funding to build a fully working prototype. If things go well, that could even scale into <strong>$50k+</strong> down the line, but first step is getting a real unit built and tested.

</div>

<div className="card margin-vert--md">
  <div className="card__body">
    <p>This is a huge milestone for the project, as it would allow us to validate the design in a real-world setting and gather actual measurements and listening impressions.</p>
  </div>
</div>

## Moving Forward

<div className="card margin-vert--md">
  <div className="card__body">
    <p>So yeah, it's been quiet on the outside, but definitely not dead. Thanks for being patient while I juggle school, life, and this project. I'll keep sharing as things move forward — and as always, I really appreciate the support from this community.</p>
    
    <p className="margin-top--md"><strong>Stay tuned for more updates!</strong></p>

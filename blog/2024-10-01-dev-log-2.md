title: Dev Log | 2 - VituixCAD Update, Driver Configuration Changes, and First Prototype

**TL;DR:** Switched to the latest VituixCAD (old file is archived under `/legacy`). If you've modified the old crossover, it won't open in the new version --- you'll need to manually copy things over. Driver setup is now CI22955 + BK23824 + 2× SWFK 31736, bringing costs down to ~$250. Dropped the PCB in favor of direct soldering since it makes shell fitting easier. Removed the outdated SMD list. First physical prototype is underway thanks to some preliminary funding.

Hey everyone,

Quick update on Project Resonator.

## VituixCAD Migration

<div className="card margin-vert--md">
  <div className="card__header">
    <h3>Moving to Latest VituixCAD</h3>
  </div>
  <div className="card__body">
    <p>The biggest change is that I've moved the crossover from a legacy version of VituixCAD to the latest release. The old one worked fine for simple filters, but once I started simulating more complex crossovers, it became inconsistent and awkward. Plus, a lot of people had trouble installing it.</p>
    
    <p className="margin-top--md">The new version is easier to get (straight from the official site) and gives more reliable results.</p>
    
    <div className="alert alert--warning margin-vert--md">
      <div className="alert__header">
        <strong>Important Note for Existing Users</strong>
      </div>
      <div className="alert__body">
        I archived the old file in a <code>/legacy</code> folder inside the crossover directory if anyone still wants to look at it, but it'll probably get dropped entirely in the future.
      </div>
    </div>
    
    <p><strong>If you've modified the old crossover circuit:</strong> It won't open in the latest version of VituixCAD. You'll need to manually copy your edits over. I know that's a bit of a hassle, but moving forward it'll make things much cleaner, and it also means I can build better tutorials since the newer version lets me break down filter designs in a clearer manner.</p>
  </div>

## Component List Cleanup

<div className="card margin-vert--md">
  <div className="card__body">
    <p>I also removed the old SMD components list directory. It was way out of date and honestly not worth keeping around since part availability changes so often. The crossover circuit files themselves already show what's being used.</p>
    
    <div className="alert alert--info margin-top--md">
      That said, I'll be putting together a cleaner and more reliable component list soon, specifically tailored for the current model, to make sourcing parts easier.
    </div>
  </div>

## Driver Configuration Update

<div className="card margin-vert--md">
  <div className="card__header">
    <h3>New Driver Setup</h3>
  </div>
  <div className="card__body">
    <p>On the driver side, I reworked the configuration. Originally it used four drivers (CI22955, BK236824, TWFK 30017, and HODVTECH), which pushed the cost above <strong>$350</strong>.</p>
    
    <p className="margin-top--md">The new setup runs:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>CI22955</strong> (Woofer)</li>
      <li><strong>BK23824</strong> (Mid)</li>
      <li><strong>2× SWFK 31736</strong> (Tweeters)</li>
    </ul>
    
    <div className="alert alert--success margin-vert--md">
      That cuts the cost down to around <strong>$250</strong> (drivers + wire + resistors, capacitors, and plug from AliExpress) without losing too much flexibility. This makes the project much more accessible while still maintaining excellent sound quality.

## Assembly Method Change: Direct Soldering

<div className="card margin-vert--md">
  <div className="card__header">
    <h3>Direct Soldering Approach</h3>
  </div>
  <div className="card__body">
    <p>Another big shift is ditching the PCB requirement. It was eating too much shell space and making the whole thing harder to assemble. Now I'm just soldering SMD components directly.</p>
    
    <p className="margin-top--md">It's a bit more tedious, but way more prototype-friendly and actually fits inside the shell better.</p>
    
    <div className="alert alert--info margin-top--md">
      The PCB design is still in the repo for anyone who wants to learn from it or build that way, but for the standard build, direct soldering is the recommended approach.

## First Physical Prototype

<div className="alert alert--success margin-vert--md">

And finally, I've actually started on a physical prototype. With some preliminary funding and the cheaper driver setup, I can finally build this thing for real.

</div>

<div className="card margin-vert--md">
  <div className="card__body">
    <p>This is a huge milestone - moving from simulation and design to an actual physical unit that can be tested, measured, and listened to. I'm excited to see how the real-world performance compares to the simulations.</p>
  </div>
</div>

## Moving Forward

<div className="card margin-vert--md">
  <div className="card__body">
    <p>That's where things stand for now. Thanks for being patient while I figure out the right balance between school, funding, and this project. Progress is steady, and I'll keep sharing updates as things move forward.</p>

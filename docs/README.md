# __Project Resonator | *The* Open-Source IEM.__  
> A love letter to the IEM/CIEM hobby.

## Technologies Used & Software Required

1. **VituixCAD**             — Tuning simulation (see install guide below)  
2. **KiCad**                 — Schematic and PCB design  
3. **Autodesk Fusion**       — Designing the IEM shell  
4. **FPGraphTracer**         — Tracking frequency and impedance responses from driver spec sheets

## Development Timeline


- [x] Moved crossover simulation to the latest VituixCAD (old version archived under `/legacy`) | Crossover  
- [x] Updated driver setup to CI22955 + BK23824 + 2× SWFK 31736 | Drivers  
- [x] Removed PCB requirement in favor of direct SMD soldering (PCB file kept for reference) | Assembly  
- [x] Removed outdated SMD components list (will add new sourcing guide soon) | Documentation  
- [X] First physical prototype in progress thanks to preliminary funding | Prototyping

- [+] [Modular, Node-based Tuning Software](https://github.com/DriftingOtter/EarCanvas)     | Software

## Philosophy & Reasoning

> I fell in love with IEMs, so I decided "why not, I'm bored."

## Can I Use These Files To Build My Own IEM?

Absolutely. I’ve set the license to be lenient for anyone who wants to use this as a base for their own commercial projects—while still keeping that open-source spirit that I’ve grown to love in the comp sci world.

I hope this gives you a head start—maybe even helps you dodge some of the mistakes I made.

*Reminder: I’m still human, and this design is far from perfect—but it should give you a solid look at what an IEM build process can look like.*

## Installation Guide

### VituixCAD + Fixing Missing File Paths

1. Go to `https://kimmosaunisto.net/`
2. Find and download latest version
3. Install it and open the `.vxp` simulation file included in this project  

You’ll probably get a bunch of “missing file path” errors—don’t worry. That just means the project is still pointing to paths from my own system.

To fix:
- Click the folder icon next to the `.frd` or `.zma` file slot
- Navigate to the correct folder for each BA driver (inside the `BA Driver Spec Sheets` folder in this repo)
- Re-link the appropriate files

*(You only need to do this once.)*

### Downloading Fusion 360 IEM Shell Files

All IEM shell files are now hosted on **MEGA**. This includes both `.stl` files for direct printing and `.f3d` Fusion files for editing.

Since GitHub has upload limits, I’ve stored them externally here:

🔗 [Mega Link For IEM Shell Files](https://mega.nz/folder/2Z4WzYDR#g-NULd1YQFsHa81YXLZzIw)

Inside, you'll find:

- `Ready-To-Prints`     | Shell prototypes you can print right away  
- `Fusion-Shell-Models` | Editable Fusion files to tweak however you’d like

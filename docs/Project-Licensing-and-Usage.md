# Project Licensing & Usage

## Overview

Project Resonator is Open Source Hardware. We believe that information regarding high-fidelity audio should be accessible, hackable, and shareable.

This project is licensed under the **CERN Open Hardware Licence Version 2 - Weakly Reciprocal (CERN-OHL-W)**.

You can read the full legal text in the `LICENSE` file in the repository, but here is a plain-English summary of what you can and cannot do.

## What You CAN Do

* **Build it yourself:** You can download the files and build these IEMs for personal use.
* **Modify it:** You can change the tuning, redesign the shell, or route the PCB differently.
* **Sell it:** You **are allowed** to manufacture and sell IEMs based on this design (commercial use is permitted).

## Reciprocity

The "Weakly Reciprocal" part of the license is the condition for using these files.

1.  **Share Your Modifications:** If you modify the design files (e.g., you change the PCB layout or the shell shape) and you distribute the resulting product (e.g., you sell the IEMs or give them to friends), you **MUST** make your modified design files available under the same license. You cannot take this open-source project, improve it, and then close-source your improvements.
2.  **Attribution:** You must keep all copyright notices and credit the original project (Project Resonator / DriftingOtter).
3.  **Distribution:** If you sell or distribute the physical IEMs, you must provide the recipient with access to the design files (or a link to where they can find them).

## Summary

* **Want to build a pair for yourself?** Go ahead!
* **Want to sell 50 pairs on Etsy?** You can! But you must include a note linking back to the source files.
* **Want to modify the design and sell it?** You can! But you must publish your modified files for everyone else to use, too.

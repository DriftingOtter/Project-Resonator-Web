# How to Contribute

## Overview

Project Resonator is, at its heart, a community initiative. While I (DriftingOtter) have provided the initial "template," the goal is for this project to evolve through the community's experimentation. Whether you are an engineer, a sound designer, or just someone who found a typo in the documentation, your help is welcome.

## Ways to Contribute

### 1. Documentation & Wiki
This wiki is a living document. If you find a section that is unclear, or if you have discovered a better way to sand a shell or route a specific wire, please feel free to submit changes. We want this to be the ultimate resource for DIY IEM builders.

### 2. Tuning & Modifications
The provided crossover is tuned to a specific target (Moondrop x Crinacle DUSK), but audio is subjective.
* **Share your Tunings:** If you modified the crossover values in VituixCAD and found a tuning you love, export the simulation files and share them!
* **Shell Shapes:** If you modified the Fusion 360 files to fit smaller ears or different connectors, submit a Pull Request (PR) with your CAD files.

### 3. Reporting Issues
If you encounter physical fitment issues with the PCB, interference in the crossover, or errors in the BoM (Bill of Materials), please open an **Issue** on the GitHub repository. Be as detailed as possible so others can replicate and fix the problem.

## How to Submit Changes (GitHub Workflow)

1.  **Fork the Repository:** Click the "Fork" button on the top right of the project page to create your own copy of the files.
2.  **Make Your Changes:** Edit the KiCad files, Fusion designs, or Markdown text in your forked repo.
3.  **Submit a Pull Request (PR):** Go back to the original Project Resonator repository and click "New Pull Request." Explain what you changed and why.

> **Note:** By contributing, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under the project's existing CERN-OHL-W license.
